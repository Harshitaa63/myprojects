# Comprehensive Image Preprocessing Pipeline for Computer Vision

This repository contains a modular image preprocessing pipeline designed to prepare and enhance input data for various computer vision tasks. Implemented in Python using OpenCV and supporting libraries, the pipeline includes twenty commonly used techniques for image normalization, feature boosting, and transformationâ€”all essential for improving model accuracy and interpretability in real-world applications.

## Overview

The pipeline is organized for flexibility and experimentation. Each preprocessing method can be applied independently or as part of a sequential workflow. The implementations are documented with code explanations, visual outputs, and practical use cases.

## Included Techniques

The preprocessing steps in this collection include:

- Image resizing
- Grayscale conversion
- Histogram equalization
- Blurring: Gaussian and Median
- Denoising
- Adaptive thresholding
- Edge detection: Canny and Sobel
- Erosion and dilation
- Image padding
- Image masking
- Rotation and flipping
- Normalization
- HSV and RGB conversion
- Image cropping
- Contour detection
- Noise simulation
- Image sharpening
- Contrast adjustment
- Image augmentation

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## Applications

This pipeline supports preprocessing for tasks such as:
- Image classification and segmentation
- Feature extraction and object detection
- Biomedical image analysis
- Model training preparation and data augmentation

## Project Structure

Each technique is implemented and documented in individual notebooks or code files. Descriptions are provided for every step, with input/output comparisons and notes on parameter selection where applicable.
