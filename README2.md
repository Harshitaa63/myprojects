20-Step Computer Vision Preprocessing Pipeline
 Overview
This project implements a comprehensive image preprocessing pipeline in Python using 20 essential techniques for preparing images for computer vision tasks. 
The goal is to enhance image quality, normalize input data, and boost model performance by applying a wide range of preprocessing methods.
Techniques Included
The pipeline includes (but is not limited to):
	•	Image resizing
	•	Grayscale conversion
	•	Histogram equalization
	•	Blurring (Gaussian, Median)
	•	Denoising
	•	Adaptive thresholding
	•	Edge detection (Canny, Sobel)
	•	Erosion & Dilation
	•	Image padding
	•	Image masking
	•	Rotation and flipping
	•	Normalization
	•	HSV and RGB conversion
	•	Image cropping
	•	Contour detection
	•	Noise simulation
	•	Image sharpening
	•	Contrast adjustment
	•	Image augmentation
